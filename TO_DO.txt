For task 1:
The sim we are using is called the SITL simulator which basically means any simulator with a pixhawk usage. ( the first command you give to launch the sim according to the doc we gave previously)
Now we gotta change the SITL mode and make it receive the mavros msgs and therefore move the bluerov 
Checkout the bluerov_ros_playground pkg 
Inside that package there are scripts and launch files thatâ€™ll help 
And before that, check out the SITL ROS official documentation which is on the Internet
These are some things that I did. If you guys can figure out a way then awesome. Keep the stuff updated here.

For task 2:
There are gazebo world files in the bluerov_ros_playground package which contains the seabed. Now we have to edit this seabed part and add some aruco markers - add 1 aruco marker to start. 
Now how to add aruco markers is something you gotta figure out. Editing world files is fun and overwhelming at the same time - my personal opinion.
